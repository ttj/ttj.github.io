abstract="Safety-critical distributed cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have been found in a wide range of applications. Notably, they have displayed a great deal of utility in intelligent transportation, where autonomous vehicles communicate and cooperate with each other via a high-speed communication network. Such systems require an ability to identify maneuvers in real-time that cause dangerous circumstances and ensure the implementation always meets safety-critical requirements. In this paper, we propose a real-time decentralized safety verification approach for a distributed multi-agent CPS with the underlying assumption that all agents are time-synchronized with a low degree of error. In the proposed approach, each agent periodically computes its local reachable set and exchanges this reachable set with the other agents with the goal of verifying the system safety. Our method, implemented in Java, takes advantages of the timing information and the reachable set information that are available in the exchanged messages to reason about the safety of the whole system in a decentralized manner. Any particular agent can also perform local safety verification tasks based on their local clocks by analyzing the messages it receives. We applied the proposed method to verify, in real-time, the safety properties of a group of quadcopters performing a distributed search mission.",

abstract = "Most agencies and decision-makers rely on crash and crash severity (property damage only, injury or fatality) data to assess transportation safety; however, in the context of public health where perceptions of safety may influence the willingness to adopt active transportation modes (e.g. bicycling and walking), pedestrian-motor vehicle and other similar conflicts types may define a better performance measure for safety assessment. In the field of transportation safety, an absolute conflict occurs when two parties’ paths cross and one of the parties must undertake an evasive maneuver (e.g. change direction or stop) to avoid a crash. Other less severe conflicts where paths cross but no evasive maneuver is required may also impact public perceptions of safety especially for vulnerable modes. Most of the existing literature focuses on vehicle conflicts. While in the past several years, more research has investigated bicycle and pedestrian conflicts, most of this has focused on the intersection environment. A comprehensive analysis of conflicts appears critical. The major objective of this study is two fold: 1) Development of an innovative and cost effective conflict data collection technique to better understand the conflicts (and their severity) involving vulnerable road users (e.g. bicycle/pedestrian, bicycle/motor vehicle, and pedestrian/motor vehicle) and their severity. 2) Test the effectiveness and practicality of the approach taken and its associated crowd sourced data collection. In an endeavor to undertake these objectives, the researchers developed an android-based crowd-sourced data collection app. The crowd-source data collected using the app is compared with traditional fatality data for hot spot analysis. At the end, the app users provide feedback about the overall competency of the app interface and the performance of its features to the app developers. If widely adopted, the app will enable communities to create their own data collection efforts to identify dangerous sites within their neighborhoods. Agencies will have a valuable data source at low-cost to help inform their decision making related to bicycle and pedestrian education, encouragement, enforcement, programs, policies, and infrastructure design and planning."

abstract="We describe a method for verifying the temporal property of persistence in non-linear hybrid systems. Given some system and an initial set of states, the method establishes that system trajectories always eventually evolve into some specified target subset of the states of one of the discrete modes of the system, and always remain within this target region. The method also computes a time-bound within which the target region is always reached. The approach combines flowpipe computation with deductive reasoning about invariants and is more general than each technique alone. We illustrate the method with a case study showing that potentially destructive stick-slip oscillations of an oil-well drill eventually die away for a certain choice of drill control parameters. The case study demonstrates how just using flowpipes or just reasoning about invariants alone can be insufficient and shows the richness of systems that one can handle with the proposed method, since the systems features modes with non-polynomial ODEs. We also propose an alternative method for proving persistence that relies solely on flowpipe computation.",

abstract="Neural networks have been widely used to solve complex real-world problems. Due to the complex, nonlinear, non-convex nature of neural networks, formal safety and robustness guarantees for the behaviors of neural network systems are crucial for their applications in safety-critical systems. In this paper, the reachable set estimation and safety verification problems for Nonlinear Autoregressive-Moving Average (NARMA) models in the forms of neural networks are addressed. The neural networks involved in the model are a class of feed-forward neural networks called Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). By partitioning the input set of an MLP into a finite number of cells, a layer-by-layer computation algorithm is developed for reachable set estimation of each individual cell. The union of estimated reachable sets of all cells forms an over-approximation of the reachable set of the MLP. Furthermore, an iterative reachable set estimation algorithm based on reachable set estimation for MLPs is developed for NARMA models. The safety verification can be performed by checking the existence of non-empty intersections between unsafe regions and the estimated reachable set. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the approach.",

   abstract = {The event-triggered control problem for switched linear system is addressed in this study. The periodical sampling scheme and event-triggering condition are incorporated in the closed-loop. The feedback control updates its value only at sampling instants as long as event-triggering condition is satisfied as well. In addition, the switchings are only allowed to occur at sampling instants and meanwhile the switching condition is satisfied. Three equivalent sufficient conditions are proposed to ensure the asymptotic stability of switched systems. In particular, one condition has a promising feature of affineness in system matrices, and as a consequence, it is extended to robust sampling case and                                                                                           L                                                2                                                      -gain analysis.

abstract={Power electronics-intensive DC microgrids use increasingly complex software-based controllers and communication networks. They are evolving into cyber-physical systems (CPS) with sophisticated interactions between physical and computational processes, making them vulnerable to cyber attacks. This work presents a framework to detect possible false-data injection attacks (FDIA) in cyber-physical DC microgrids. The detection problem is formalized as identifying a change in sets of inferred candidate invariants. Invariants are microgrids properties that do not change over time. Both the physical plant and the software controller of CPS can be described as Simulink/Stateflow (SLSF) diagrams. The dynamic analysis infers the candidate invariants over the input/output variables of SLSF components. The reachability analysis generates the sets of reachable states (reach sets) for the CPS modeled as hybrid automata. The candidate invariants that contain the reach sets are called the actual invariants. The candidate invariants are then compared with the actual invariants, and any mismatch indicates the presence of FDIA. To evaluate the proposed methodology, the hybrid automaton of a DC microgrid, with a distributed cooperative control scheme, is presented. The reachability analysis is performed to obtain the reach sets and, hence, the actual invariants. Moreover, a prototype tool, HYbrid iNvariant GEneratoR (Hynger), is extended to instrument SLSF models, obtain candidate invariants, and identify FDIA.},

There is a digitizer for each linear subsystem that periodically samples an input signal and produces an output that is quantized and saturated.

Due to digitization, each subsystem behaves as a switched affine system, where state-dependent switches are induced by the digitizer.  For each quantization region, a storage function is computed for each subsystem by solving appropriate linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and the sum of these storage functions is a Lyapunov function for the interconnected system.  Finally, using a condition on the sampling period, we specify a subset of the unsaturated state space from which all executions of the interconnected system reach a neighborhood of the quantization region containing the origin.  The sampling period proves to be pivotal---if it is too small, then a dwell-time argument cannot be used to establish convergence, while if it is too large, an unstable subsystem may not receive timely-enough inputs to avoid diverging.},

Due to the distributed control and inherent redundancy in the system composed of many panels and inverter modules, the system topology exhibits fault-tolerance capabilities that we study through virtual prototyping. The fault-tolerance is enabled by several distributed algorithms, such as services to identify which, if any, agents controlling inverter modules have failed. A distributed identifier algorithm allows the system to keep track of the number of operating panels to appropriately regulate the dc voltage output of the panels using buck�boost converters and determine appropriate switching times for H-bridges in the grid-tie. We evaluate the distributed inverter, its control strategy, and fault-tolerance through thousands of simulation scenarios in Mathworks Simulink/Stateflow. Our virtual prototyping framework allows for generating multilevel inverters composed of many inverter modules, and we evaluate inverters composed of five to dozens of inverter modules. Our analysis suggests the achievable total harmonic distortion of the modular multilevel inverter may allow for operating solar arrays in spite of failures of the power electronics, control software, and other subcomponents.},

The method utilizes a symmetric representation of the set of reachable states (modulo the automata indices) that we call anonymized states, which makes it scalable.  Rather than explicitly enumerating each automaton index in formulas representing sets of states, the anonymized representation encodes only: (a) the classes of automata, which are the states of automata represented with formulas over symbolic indices, and (b) the number of automata in each of the classes.  We present an algorithm for overapproximating the reachable states by computing state transitions in this anonymized representation.  Unlike symmetry reduction techniques used in finite state models, the timed transition of a network composed of hybrid automata causes the continuous variables of all the automata to evolve simultaneously.  The anonymized representation is amenable to both reducing the discrete and continuous complexity.  We evaluate a prototype implementation of the representation and reachability algorithm in our satisfiability modulo theories (SMT)-based tool, Passel.  Our experimental results are promising, and generally allow for scaling to networks composed of tens of automata, and in some instances, hundreds (or more) of automata.},

The state of this switch gives rise to the locations of the hybrid automaton, and the continuous variables are currents and voltages.

    abstract    =   {Distributed cyber-physical systems (CPS) incorporate communicating agents with their own cyber and physical states and transitions. Such systems are typically designed to accomplish tasks in the physical world. For example, the objective of a robotic swarm may be to cover an area while avoiding collisions. The combination of physical dynamics, software dynamics, and communications leads these systems naturally to be modeled as networks of hybrid automata. Hybrid automata are finite-state machines with additional real-valued continuous variables whose dynamics may vary in different states. These networks are naturally parameterized on the number of participants---processes, robots, vehicles, etc. The uniform verification problem is to verify (prove) some property regardless of the number of participants. In this dissertation, we develop a framework for formally modeling and automatically verifying networks composed of arbitrarily many participants. Three methods are presented and evaluated for proving safety properties---those that always hold throughout the evolutions of the system.
                The first method is a backward search from the set of unsafe states, which are those that violate a desired safety property. The method computes the set of reachable states for a parameterized network, and checks that the intersection of the reachable states and unsafe states is empty. We apply this technique using the Model Checker Modulo Theories (MCMT) verification tool to automatically verify safe separation of aircraft in a conceptual air traffic landing protocol of the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS), regardless of the number of aircraft involved in the protocol.
                The Passel verification tool we develop as a part of this dissertation implements the next two methods and can verify safety properties of parameterized networks of hybrid automata with dynamics specified as rectangular differential inclusions. The second method computes the set of reachable states for networks composed of a finite number of participants. While this method cannot in general prove safety regardless of the number of participants, it can be used as a subroutine for other methods, such as synthesizing candidate inductive invariants to perform uniform verification. It is also useful on its own as an initial sanity check prior to attempting to prove properties regardless of the number of participants, which is harder in general---in terms of decidability and complexity.
                The third method---when it is successful---automates the traditionally deductive verification approach of proving inductive invariants. This is accomplished by combining model checking with theorem proving. An algorithm synthesizes candidate inductive invariants by computing the reachable states of finite instantiations. The conditions for inductive invariance are then checked for these candidates. If a small model theorem applies, finite instantiations of the parameterized network can be checked, but in general, a theorem prover is queried.  In this case, the inductive invariance conditions are encoded as satisfiability checks, for which it may be possible to discharge automatically.  When these steps are successful, a fully automatic verification of safety is achieved.
                The main contributions of this thesis include (a) the modeling framework for parameterized networks of hybrid automata, (b) the first fully automatic uniform verification of parameterized networks composed of hybrid automata with rectangular dynamics, such as Fischer's mutual exclusion protocol and SATS, (c) formalization of the SATS case study as a uniform verification problem, (d) the Passel verification tool, (e) an extension of the invisible invariants and split invariants approaches for invariant synthesis to networks of hybrid automata, and (f) a small model theorem for checking inductive invariance conditions of networks of rectangular hybrid automata.},

The methodology is useful for automating the traditionally manual process of deductive verification of safety properties, such as collision avoidance, and establishes such properties regardless of the number of participants involved in a protocol. We illustrate the methodology using a simplified model of the landing protocol of the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) as a case study. Each participant (aircraft) in the protocol is modeled as a hybrid automaton with both discrete and continuous states and potentially nondeterministic evolution thereof. Discrete states change instantaneously according to transitions and continuous states evolve according to rectangular differential inclusions. The invariant synthesis method enables a fully automatic verification of the main safety property of SATS, namely, safe separation of aircraft on approach to the runway. The method is implemented in a prototype verification tool called Passel. We present promising experimental results using the methodology, which has enabled a fully automatic proof of safe separation for the model of SATS.},

A verification tool such as SpaceEx is based on the exploration of a symbolic search space (the region space). As a verification tool, it is typically optimized towards proving the absence of errors. In some settings, e.g., when the verification tool is employed in a feedback-directed design cycle, one would like to have the option to call a version that is optimized towards finding an error path in the region space. A recent approach in this direction is based on guided search. Guided search relies on a cost function that indicates which states are promising to be explored, and preferably explores more promising states first. In this paper, we introduce an abstraction-based cost function based on pattern databases for guiding the reachability analysis. For this purpose, we introduce a suitable abstraction technique that exploits the flexible granularity of modern reachability analysis algorithms. Our cost function is an effective extension of pattern database approaches that have been successfully applied in other areas. We have implemented our approach in the SpaceEx model checker. Our evaluation shows its practical potential.},

For an individual agent, such as a mobile phone, tablet, or robot, a trace is a finite sequence of state observations and message histories. Each recording has a possibly inaccurate timestamp from the agent's local clock. The challenge is to symbolically overapproximate the reachable states of the entire system from the unsynchronized traces of the individual devices. The presented algorithm first approximates the time of occurrence of each event, based on the synchronization errors of the local clocks, and then overapproximates the reach sets of the continuous variables between consecutive observations. The algorithm is shown to be sound; it is also complete for a class of agents with restricted continuous dynamics and when the traces have precise information about timing synchronization inaccuracies. The algorithm is implemented in an SMT solver-based tool for analyzing traces of distributed Android Apps. Experimental results using the tool illustrate that interesting properties like safe separation, correct geocast delivery, and distributed deadlocks can be automatically checked and potential counterexamples can be found. Analyzing these properties on a 10 second long distributed trace for 20 agents completes within a minute and often in seconds, suggesting that the approach can scale.},

Establishing liveness in such systems is challenging, but such analysis will be necessary to apply such distributed traffic control algorithms in applications like the intelligent highway system and for coordinating robot swarms.  We present a distributed traffic control protocol that guarantees minimum separation between vehicles, even as some cells fail.  Once new failures cease occurring, in the case of a single target, the protocol is guaranteed to self-stabilize and the vehicles with feasible paths to the target cell make progress towards it.  For multiple targets, failures may cause deadlocks in the system, so we identify a class of non-deadlocking failures where all vehicles are able to make progress to their respective targets.  The algorithm relies on two general principles: temporary blocking for maintenance of safety and local geographical routing for guaranteeing progress.  Our assertional proofs may serve as a template for the analysis of other distributed traffic control protocols.  We present simulation results that provide estimates of throughput as a function of vehicle velocity, safety separation, single-target path complexity, failure-recovery rates, and multi-target path complexity.},

For such systems, formal verification guarantees are particularly attractive.  This paper presents automatic verification techniques for providing assurances in satellite maneuvers.  The specific reliability criteria studied are rendezvous and conjunction avoidance for two satellites performing orbital transfers.  Three factors pose challenges for verifying satellite systems: (a) incommensurate orbits, (b) uncertainty of orbital parameters after thrusting, and (c) nonlinear dynamics.  Three abstractions are proposed for contending with these challenges: (a) quotienting of the state-space based on periodicity of the orbital dynamics, (b) aggregation of similar transfer orbits, and (c) overapproximation of nonlinear dynamics using hybridization.  The method's feasibility is established via experiments with a prototype tool that computes the abstractions and uses existing hybrid systems model checkers.},

Each aircraft is modeled as a timed automaton with (possibly unbounded) counters.  SATS is then described as the composition of $N$ such aircraft, where $N$ is a parameter from the natural numbers.  We verify several safety properties for arbitrary $N$,  the most important of which is separation assurance, which ensures that no two aircraft may ever collide.  The verification methodology relies on computing the set of backward reachable states from the set of unsafe states to a fixed point, and checking emptiness of the intersection of these reachable states and the initial set of states.  We used the Model Checker Modulo Theories (MCMT) tool, which implements this technique.},

The second method uses model checking to verify circuits that can naturally be modeled as timed automata.  We demonstrate the method on an open-loop multilevel converter used to convert several DC inputs to one AC output.  The method is also automatic and uses the timed automata model checker Uppaal.

There is a digitizer for each linear subsystem that periodically samples an input signal and produces an output that is quantized and saturated.  The output of the digitizer is then fed as an input (in the usual sense) to the linear subsystem.  Due to digitization, each subsystem behaves as a switched affine system, where state-dependent switches are induced by the digitizer.  For each quantization region, a storage function is computed for each subsystem by solving appropriate linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and the sum of these storage functions is a Lyapunov function for the interconnected system.  Finally, using a condition on the sampling period, we specify a subset of the unsaturated state space from which all executions of the interconnected system reach a neighborhood of the quantization region containing the origin.  The sampling period proves to be pivotal---if it is too small, then a dwell-time argument cannot be used to establish convergence, while if it is too large, an unstable subsystem may not receive timely-enough inputs to avoid diverging.},

In this paper, we study one-dimensional safe flocking in the presence of actuator faults and directional failure detectors (DFDs).  Actuator faults cause affected agents to move permanently with arbitrary velocities, and DFDs detect failures only when actuation and required motion are in opposing directions.  First, assuming existence of a DFD for actuator faults, we present an algorithm for safe flocking.  Next, we show that certain actuator faults cannot be detected with DFDs, while detecting others requires time that grows linearly with the number of participating agents.  Finally, we show that our DFD algorithm achieves the latter bound.},

    abstract    =   {In environments where electromechanical loads may suffer from disturbances with large magnitude---such as in sampling downhole reservoirs---stalling protection for the power source of the alternator may be critical to prevent potentially catastrophic system failure.  First, a real-time estimation method is described to determine the maximum available electrical power produced by a turbo-alternator for a given volumetric flow rate acting on the turbine.  Next, the available-power estimate and used electrical power measurement are used to prevent turbine stalling by regulating an electromechanical load---in this case a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM)---to draw less power.  The stalling protection is implemented through an additional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for load power, which is cascaded outside already cascaded velocity and torque PID controllers used for control of the PMSM.  To ensure fast tracking, the power PID controller implements integral anti-windup.  An experimental evaluation of the methodology is presented.},

Safe flocking in Euclidean spaces is a well-studied and difficult coordination problem. Motivated by real-world deployment of multi-agent systems, this paper studies one-dimensional safe flocking, where agents are afflicted by actuator faults. An actuator fault is a new type of failure that causes an affected agent to be stuck moving with an arbitrary velocity. In this setting, first, a self-stabilizing solution for the problem is presented. This relies on a failure detector for actuator faults. Next, it is shown that certain actuator faults cannot be detected, while others may require $O(N)$ time for detection. Finally, a simple failure detector that achieves the latter bound is presented. Several simulation results are presented for illustrating the effects of failures on the progress towards flocking.},

Towards this end, we study the problem of distributed traffic control in a partitioned plane where the movement of all entities (vehicles) within each partition (or cell) is controlled by a single process.  We present a distributed traffic control protocol that guarantees minimum separation between vehicles at all times, even when some cell-processes fail by crashing.  Once failures cease, the protocol is guaranteed to stabilize and the packets with feasible paths to the target cell make progress towards it.  The algorithm relies on two general principles: local geographical routing, and temporary blocking for maintenance of safety.  Our proofs use mostly assertional reasoning and may serve as a template for analyzing other distributed traffic control protocols.  We also present simulation results which provide estimates of throughput as a function of velocity, safety separation, and path complexity.  Further, we present simulation results to estimate throughput as a function of failure and recovery rates.},

    abstract    =   {Fault-tolerance in distributed computing systems has been investigated extensively in the literature and has a rich history and detailed theory.  This thesis studies fault-tolerance for distributed cyber-physical systems (DCPS), where distributed computation is combined with dynamics of physical processes.  Due to their interaction with the physical world, DCPS may suffer from failures that are qualitatively different from the types of failures studied in distributed computing.  Failures of the components of DCPS which interact with the physical processes---such as actuators and sensors---must be considered. Failures in the cyber domain may interact with failures of sensors and actuators in adverse ways.
                 This thesis takes a first step in analyzing fault-tolerance in DCPS through the presentation of two case studies.  In each case study, the DCPS are modeled as distributed algorithms executed by a set of agents, where each agent acts independently based on information obtained from its communication neighbors and agents may suffer from various failures.  The first case study is a distributed traffic control problem, where agents control regions of roadway to move vehicles toward a destination, in spite of some agents' computers crashing permanently.  The second case study is a distributed flocking problem, where agents form a flock, or a roughly equally spaced distribution in one dimension, and move towards a destination, in spite of some agents' actuators becoming stuck at some value.
                 Each algorithm incorporates self-stabilization in order to solve the problem in spite of failures.  The traffic algorithm uses a local signaling mechanism to guarantee safety and a self-stabilizing routing protocol to guarantee progress.  The flocking algorithm uses a failure detector combined with an additional control strategy to ensure safety and progress.},
