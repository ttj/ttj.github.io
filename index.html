                        <p>
                            Taylor was previously an Assistant Professor of <a href="http://cse.uta.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</a>
                            at the <a href="http://www.uta.edu/">University of Texas at Arlington</a> (September 2013 to August 2016).
                            Taylor earned a PhD in <a href="http://ece.illinois.edu/">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> (ECE) from the
                            <a href="http://www.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a> in 2013, where he worked in the
                            <a href="http://csl.illinois.edu/">Coordinated Science Laboratory</a> with
                            <a href="http://users.crhc.illinois.edu/mitras/">Prof. Sayan Mitra</a>, and earlier earned an MSc in ECE at Illinois in 2010
                            and a BSEE from <a href="http://www.rice.edu/">Rice University</a> in 2008.

                        <p>
                            Taylor's research focus is developing formal verification techniques and software tools for cyber-physical systems (CPS),
                            with a focus most recently on autonomous CPS that incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) components,
                            such as neural networks, for tasks ranging from sensing/perception through planning/control. Taylor has published around a hundred
                            papers on these methods and their applications across CPS domains, such as power and energy systems, aerospace and avionics systems,
                            automotive systems, transportation systems, and robotics, three of which were recognized with best/outstanding paper awards,
                            from the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a> and <a href="http://www.ifip.org/">IFIP</a>, and two of which were awarded
                            Best Software Repeatability/Artifact Awards.
